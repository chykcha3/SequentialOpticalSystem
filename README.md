# SequentialOpticalSystem
MATLAB-based sequential optical system simulation in paraxial approximation.

This is ray tracing with sequental interface. Lenses and obstacles can be used. Simulations consider finite nonzero wavelength, handles phase changing, so correct diffraction patterns also possible to observe.

Please, check scenario* files for usage examples.
